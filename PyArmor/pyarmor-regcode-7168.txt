Thank you for purchasing Pyarmor Pro License, here it is activation code for license no. "pyarmor-vax-7168"

xX5Dor4UpjXosTQfCQIzfxy0mSo7ikZ4O2hN7TTHtUyiho0ooRIaCYLyVLfZlNnp8c1gm2KwnVM__eB2EBupvoqgLsN8QlaMYfycudbho65Ei2W6aW_igDb7Y-sdQMW_TIOvUUce-aSEB5I-k0qI9q8KyaqznhirNTqJpTAZlllNZg8wxSQ4kYFFF8up90hb

Internet connection and Pyarmor 9.0+ are required to activate this code, install Pyarmor and check Pyarmor version by this command

    pip install -U pyarmor
    pyarmor -v

Here are initial registration steps:

1. Download the attachment of this email, save it as "pyarmor-regcode-7168.txt"

2. Run the following command to activate this license, please replace "XXX" with product name or "non-profits" (only for obfuscating non-commercial projects)

     pyarmor reg -p XXX pyarmor-regcode-7168.txt

3. The registration file "pyarmor-regfile-7168.zip" will be created in the current path if this license is activated sucessfully

IMPORTANT NOTES:

* Please backup "pyarmor-regcode-7168.txt", but do not use it to register Pyarmor
* Please backup regfile "pyarmor-regfile-7168.zip", and use this file for next any registration
* Do not use this file in docker container and CI/CD pipeline
* Pyarmor Team doesn't provide LOST FOUND SERVICE

This registration file can be used to register Pyarmor in at most 100 devices

    pyarmor reg pyarmor-regfile-7168.zip

Check the new registration information

    pyarmor -v

On each device it's enough to register Pyarmor once, do not register Pyarmor before each obfuscation

If register "pyarmor-regfile-7168.zip" in docker container or CI/CD pipeline, each run will be taken as one new device, in 30 days only 100 runs available
